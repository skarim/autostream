# Getting Started

After installation, **autostream** only requires a short, one-time setup using an iPhone or iPad.

## Initial Setup

1. Run the installer (see README.md)

2. After installation, connect your input devices (turntable, SPDIF dongle, USB preamp, etc.) and then reboot the system.

3. Using **Safari** on your iPhone or iPad, navigate to:

   ```
   http://autostream.local/
   ```

4. The system will prompt for your PIN and will then guide you through two simple setup pages.

### Setup Page 1 — Speaker Selection

On the first setup page, all available **AirPlay / AirPlay 2** speakers on your network should appear.

* Deselect any speakers you do not want to be available in this autostream appliance.
* **Use uncompressed audio**: When enabled (recommended), sends CD-quality uncompressed audio to AirPlay speakers for the best sound quality. This is ideal for vinyl records and CDs. Uses more network bandwidth but less CPU on the Raspberry Pi. Disable only if you experience network connectivity issues.
* Tap **Continue** when finished.

If your speakers do not appear:

* Ensure they are powered on
* Tap **Refresh** to rescan the network

### Setup Page 2 — Input & Defaults

On the second setup page:

1. Choose your connected **input device** from the list.
2. If you have a second input connected, enable it and select that device as well.

Next, choose:

* **Default speakers**
* **Default volume level**

When the system has been idle for some time, these default speakers will automatically start playing when music is detected. Any other previously selected speakers will be muted.

Tap **Done** to complete setup.
The system will then show the autostream **Home Screen**

## Home Screen Web App Mode

autostream is designed to be used from your device’s home screen for an easy, app-like experience.

### Add autostream to the Home Screen

1. Open autostream in **Safari**
2. Tap the **Share** button at the bottom of the screen

Once added, autostream behaves like a regular app — providing quick access to volume controls and speaker selection without opening Safari manually.
